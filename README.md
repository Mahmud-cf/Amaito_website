# Amaito_website

This is my current company website. 

-- I handled the front-end development of our company website, ensuring a user-friendly and aesthetically pleasing experience.

-- This React app utilizes React-Bootstrap, React-Router, and React-Syntax-Highlighter, and the design of this website is entirely my own idea.

-- I encountered some compatibility issues while integrating PrismJS with React-Syntax-Highlighter.
